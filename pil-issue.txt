 i am getting a pil (pithon image library) issue, and managed to fix it, see below how i have fix it in the lambda layer

AWS Lambda function is failing because the PIL module (specifically its _imaging submodule) isn't working correctly in the Lambda environment.

The issue happens because:

The version of Pillow (PIL) that was compiled for a different OS than Lambda's runtime

1. I downgraded the version of python on my laptop
recreate the package, did not work

2. change the python package on console and test  run.

       }
     }
   ]
}

some diagnosis done 
Diagnose console errors with Amazon Q
Analysis
The error message indicates that the Lambda function is unable to import the '_imaging' module from the 'PIL' (Python Imaging Library) package. This suggests an issue with the function's runtime environment or the package dependencies.
Resolution
Try the following steps to resolve your error:


Navigate to the Lambda function 'ExifCleaner' in the AWS Console

In the 'Code' tab of the function, check if the 'PIL' (Python Imaging Library) package is properly included in the deployment package

If 'PIL' is not included, add it to the function's deployment package:

Create a new directory on your local machine
Install the 'Pillow' package (which provides PIL) using pip:
pip install Pillow -t ./
Zip the contents of this directory along with your Lambda function code
Upload the new zip file to the Lambda function
If 'PIL' is already included, ensure you're using a compatible version:

Check the Python runtime version of your Lambda function (currently python3.10)
Ensure the 'Pillow' version is compatible with this Python version
If the issue persists, try using a Lambda layer:

Create a new Lambda layer with the 'Pillow' package
Add this layer to your Lambda function
Update the function configuration:

Increase the 'Memory' allocation (currently 128 MB) to at least 256 MB
Increase the 'Timeout' (currently 3 seconds) to a higher value, e.g., 10 seconds
After making these changes, save and deploy the updated Lambda function

Test the function again to see if the error is resolved

If the error persists, check the CloudWatch logs for any additional error messages or stack traces
